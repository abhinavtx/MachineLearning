## Introduction

In this repository, I've gathered various machine learning projects, tutorials, and exercises that I've completed as part of my learning journey. These projects cover a wide range of machine learning concepts and techniques, including but not limited to:

- Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Reinforcement Learning

Each project is contained within its own directory, along with any necessary data and documentation.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Mobile Price Classification**: A project where I built a supervised learning model to classify the prices of mobiles.
2. **Predicting Car Prices**: A regression task where I developed a model to predict house prices based on various features.
3. **Credit Card Users Segmentation using K-means**: An unsupervised learning project where I segmented credit card users based on their purchasing behavior.


## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinavtx/MachineLearning.git
```

## Usage

To use the code and datasets provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory of your choice.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the project's README file.
3. Run the code using your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python scripts).

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different algorithms, and modify as needed for your own projects!
